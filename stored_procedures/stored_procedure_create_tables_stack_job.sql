-- this script creates table stack_job2 from scratch (no deleting and infilling based on earliest start_dt like the stored procedures for the "consolidated" tables)
-- stack job provides events of a member journey in long format; Original intent of this table was to track active member population (an interaction of mem status and mem type), including those suspended, on leave, etc. 
-- trial related information is excluded from the feeder tables (although it appears in the feeder tables, it's filtered when creating stack_job2 (events such as "trial conversion" & "trial expiration" are left off, which is OK because activity is only considered AFTER a member joins/converts)
/* **************  Field Key
- mt_cancel_flag = set to 'Y' when 'type_raw' contains the word "cancelled"; necessary bc a cancelled event was never recorded on the 'status' table
- NOTE: consolidated tables (consolidated_mem_type & consolidated_mem_status) may contain duplicates when evaluated on a certain subset of fields (and not others)

*/
-- join mem_status to mem_type, which is the only way to associate prevailing membership type (mem_typeXXX.type_clean) to mem_status activity; then stack so that each row is a membership event period for ea email (records having null values for mt_type_clean are mem_type original records; it's mem_status that will have non-null values)
-- UPDATING STATEMENT to replace the "lead_date" for "TYPE" rows
-- the lead and start_dt fields are exclusive to either type or status changes, this is bc I related all status changes to the prevailing type and I need the type range in order to accomplish that; this means I HAVE TO recompute the lead/start date post compilation
-- orchestration.ipynb creates the two consolidated tables (type and status) from the output tables of the respective stored procedures for those tables; code snippet: the copy_rename('consolidated_mem_status_temp2', ['consolidated_mem_status','consolidated_mem_status_temp'], 'consolidated_mem_status')

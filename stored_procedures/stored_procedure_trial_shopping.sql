-- ************** THE BELOW REQUIRES THE SHOP LOG TO BE IMPORTED INTO MYSQL DB FIRST************
-- PRE-REQUISITE: ingest member shopping activity via ingestMemberShopping.ipynb -> "shop_log" table
/* SCRIPT LOGIC:
-- join shopping data ("shop_log") to mem_type data (updated via orchestratyion.ipynb); later: freq of shopping for trial members, while in-trial, and relate to type conversions
-- all recorded/historical shopping is categorized (in/pre/post trial) for each iteration of their trial (ie I don't attempt to segregate shopping activity and assign it to a trial - it's always all considered)
-- trialShoppingHabits = transactional table of trial member shopping activity (exclusively): one record per shopping trip that classifies it as in/pre/out of trial, whether a conversion occurred, total trips while in-trial
-- if this version doesn't work, consult trialShoppingHabitsDiagnostics.sql for extensive QA
